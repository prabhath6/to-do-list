This is a simple ToDoList Application made using React and some simple CSS. This is based of [Building an Awesome Todo List App in React](https://www.kirupa.com/react/simple_todo_app_react.htm), which is a really good way to go after completing the official React tutorial.

This is a bit different from the above linked tutorial, this uses arrow functions to handle events in the application instead of defining a function and binding `this` to each of the functions.

To get started:

Install all the dependencies

`npm install`

To start the application

`npm start`
